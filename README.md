# WARPERS

Warpers was the winner project of the #49 BootCamp Hackathon, made from scratch and in 24h.
The name was inspired on the song "Rocky Horror Picture Show - Time Warp", given to us as our main theme.

Warpers solve a real life problem. Imagine that you want to subscribe Netflix but it's to expensive for you alone. And you tried to join with friends and family but you know how complicated these things can be!
Well, we created the perfect solution for you. Warpers is a web-app that helps registered people manage theirs subscriptions. Using these app you don't have to worried about not having enough friends to subscribe a more economic package. We do all of that for you. Just join us and warp you time by doing what you love to do!
